# gotth

This is a simple testing application for using Golang and HTMX to build a fullstack web app.

The name gotth is just the stack I'm using. I saw the name somewhere on youtube:

-    go - [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/)
-    t - [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/t) (I just like using it so I'm gonna on personal projects)
-    t - [templ](https://templ.guide/htm) for html templating
-    h - [htmx](https://htmx.org/)

I'm using [AIR](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for automatic project/server reloading. It's similar to Nodemon.

I'm using the installable [tailwindcss standalone executable](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) here, so I don't have to use npm. You'll only need it for local development.
